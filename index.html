          In high school, I decided to audition for the school play. I was given a minor role, but I was excited. 
          During rehearsals, I learned a lot about acting and teamwork. On the night of the performance, 
          I felt a rush of excitement as I stepped on stage. The experience was exhilarating, and the applause 
          from the audience was incredibly rewarding. A similar sense of satisfaction came when I volunteered for community clean-up
           event. Equipped with gloves and a trash bag, I joined my neighbors in picking up litter at a local park. The camaraderie 
           and pride in making the park cleaner were uplifting. By the end of the day, seeing the park free of litter was incredibly 
           satisfying,much like the rewarding feeling after the play.

          During my high school years, I embarked on an internship journey in the realm of technical engineering, 
          collaborating closely with my father. This immersive experience enabled me to delve into the intricacies of 
          engineering practices, honing my problem-solving abilities and deepening my understanding of engineering principles.
           Working side by side with my father not only fostered a strong bond but also provided invaluable mentorship, 
           broadening my perspective on potential career paths within the technical engineering field.
